# Installing Xalan-C++

Prebuilt packages of Xalan-C++ are not provided by the Apache Xalan-C++
project.  However, several organisations provide binary builds of
Xalan-C++.  Existing providers include:

| OS      | Distributor   | Package |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| BSD     | FreeBSD Ports | [xalan-c](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/textproc/xalan-c/) |
| Linux   | Debian        | [libxalan-c-dev](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libxalan-c-dev&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all) |
| Linux   | Fedora and EPEL (for RHEL and CentOS) | [xalan-c-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/xalan-c-devel) |
| Linux   | Gentoo        | [dev-libs/xalan-c](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/xalan-c) |
| Linux   | Ubuntu        | [libxalan-c-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=all&arch=any&searchon=names&keywords=libxalan-c-dev) |
| macOS   | [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) | [xalan-c](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/xalan-c#default) |
| macOS   | [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) | [xalanc](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=xalanc) |
| Windows | [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) | [xalan-c](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/xalan-c/CONTROL) |

The table above is by no means exhaustive.  Other distributors may also
provide binary packages for their platforms.

Once installed from a prebuilt package, Xalan-C++ should be immediately
ready to use.
